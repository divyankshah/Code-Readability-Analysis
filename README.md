# Code-Readability-Analysis

This project implements a **readability analysis framework for Java code snippets**, combining **software metrics** with **machine learning classification**. 

---

## üìå Overview

The tool analyzes Java code snippets (`.jsnp` files) and extracts several well-known software metrics that correlate with readability.  
It then builds a labeled dataset using human readability scores and applies a machine learning classifier to predict readability.

## ‚ú® Features

The following readability metrics are implemented:

1. **Number of Lines (LOC)**  
   Counts the total number of lines in a snippet (including comments and blanks).

2. **Halstead Volume**  
   - Derived from the number of distinct and total operators (`n1`, `N1`) and operands (`n2`, `N2`).  
   - Formula:  
     \[
     V = (N1 + N2) \times \log_2(n1 + n2)
     \]

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**  
   - Starts at 1, and increments for each control flow element:  
     `if`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`, `switch` cases, `catch` blocks, ternary `?:`, and logical connectors (`&&`, `||`).

4. **Token Entropy**  
   - Uses Shannon entropy over token distributions (including whitespace and special symbols).  
   - Captures predictability vs. diversity of tokens.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Preprocessing (Dataset Creation)**  
   - Extracts the selected feature metrics from `.jsnp` files.  
   - Reads a *ground truth CSV* containing human readability ratings.  
   - Converts ratings into binary labels:  
     - Average score ‚â• **3.6** ‚Üí `Y` (Readable)  
     - Average score < **3.6** ‚Üí `N` (Not Readable)  
   - Saves the output as a **CSV dataset**.

2. **Classification**  
   - Loads the dataset with **Weka**.  
   - Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier.  
   - Evaluates via **10-fold cross-validation**.  
   - Reports Accuracy, Area Under ROC, and F-Score.
